/****************
***************** Configure IoC with Spring ****************************/

1. Configure Spring Beans with xml tag <bean></bean>.
2. Create 'Spring Container' generally known as 'Application Context'.
   Specialized Implementation:
   a. ClassPathXmlApplicationContext
   b. AnnotationConfigApplicationContext
   c. GenericWebApplicationContext
   others...
   Here we need to pass application context file name to their objects.
3. Retrieve Spring beans from Container.
   Get context object.
   To get object use context.getBean(id_bean, Interface_name.class) on it.
4. Close the context object.


To see Inversion of Control (IoC) achived or not by configuration file.
We just need to go to application context file and change class name to Different class which is implementing same interface.
No need to do changes in source code.
