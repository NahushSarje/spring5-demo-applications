/****************
***************** Configure App with Spring ****************************/

1. Configure Spring Beans with xml tag <bean></bean>.
2. Create 'Spring Container' generally known as 'Application Context'.
   Specialized Implementation:
   a. ClassPathXmlApplicationContext
   b. AnnotationConfigApplicationContext
   c. GenericWebApplicationContext
   others...
   Here we need to pass application context file name to their objects.
3. Retrieve Spring beans from Container.
   Get context object.
   To get object use context.getBean(id_bean, Interface_name.class) on it.
4. Close the context object.
